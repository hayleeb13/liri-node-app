# liri-node-app

* The project uses node and takes in four different commands that produce different outputs.
* The command options are: movie-this, spotify-this-song, event-this, and do-what-it-says.
* The user can enter one of these commands followed by the necessary input and the program will display the related information.
* If the user inputs a command without an input after then the program displays predetermined information.
* The project is useful because it allows someone to quickly obtain relevant data without having to do an extensive search.
* Simply get started by entering "node liri.js" followed by one of the commands and a search term.
* Any questions or issues regarding this program can be directed to Haylee Bell email hayleeb13@gmail.com.
